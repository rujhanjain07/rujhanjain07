## Overview

I design **applied AI systems** that operate beyond notebooks and demos.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- modern AI models  
- real, imperfect data  
- system constraints and product requirements  

I’m most effective when AI is treated as a **system component**, not a feature.

---

## What I Focus On

### 🧠 Agentic & Generative AI
- LLM-powered systems using **RAG, embeddings, and vector databases**
- Multi-step agent workflows with **LangGraph / LangChain**
- Intent routing, tool use, memory, and decision loops
- Designing AI workflows that map to real business processes

---

### 👁️ Computer Vision Systems
- Visual inspection and defect detection (YOLO-based)
- Pose estimation and movement analysis (Mediapipe)
- Systems designed with attention to **latency, throughput, and reliability**
- Experience across **manufacturing and healthcare** contexts

---

### 🏗️ Platforms & Tooling
- Designing internal AI platforms and developer tools
- Full-stack understanding across **AI, backend services, and data pipelines**
- Bridging **open-source ML** with **enterprise-grade systems**
- Bias toward clarity, maintainability, and inspectable execution

---

## Selected Work

> This is a curated set. Focus is on **problem framing and system design**, not volume.

### 🔹 OrchestR-OSS · Agentic Workflow Tooling
A local-first, open-source developer tool for visually designing and validating agentic AI workflows and compiling them into executable Python projects.

- Visual workflow editor with explicit node and edge semantics
- Workflow validation and structural guarantees
- Visual-to-code compilation approach
- Designed for transparency, correctness, and developer control

---

### 🔹 Agentic RAG System for Cross-Dataset Analysis & Fraud Detection
An agentic AI system to query and analyze multiple heterogeneous tabular datasets  
with **no shared keys and inconsistent schemas**.

- RAG-based schema grounding and dataset routing
- SQL generation for single-dataset queries
- Cross-dataset entity resolution via fuzzy matching
- Rule-based fraud pattern analysis
- Persistent vector memory reused across sessions
- LLM-agnostic, modular agent architecture

---

### 🔹 Agentic AI for HRMS (Product Work)
AI-powered HRMS SaaS designed for intelligent automation and executive decision support.

- Architected LLM-based workflows for HR operations, defining agent roles, logic, and data flow
- Designed enterprise data integration strategy, including security, scalability, and system boundaries
- Owned end-to-end AI system design, product flow, and technical specifications for implementation

---

### 🔹 Computer Vision Applications
Applied CV systems built for real-world constraints:
- Visual quality inspection for pharmaceutical manufacturing
- Real-time physiotherapy monitoring using pose estimation and motion analysis

---

## Tech Stack (What I Actually Use)

**Languages**
- Python · SQL · JavaScript

**AI / ML**
- PyTorch · Hugging Face · LangGraph · LlamaIndex
- LLMs · RAG · Embeddings · Prompt Engineering  
- YOLO · Mediapipe · Vibe Coding

**Systems**
- FastAPI · Node.js  
- Docker · Containerized services  
- Streaming & data pipelines (Kafka)
- Continuous Integration via Github Actions

**Enterprise Context**
- SAS Viya · Model Manager  
- Hybrid stacks combining open-source ML and enterprise platforms

---

## Beyond Engineering

- Represented enterprise AI and analytics solutions at **GITEX Dubai 2025**
- Regularly involved in **solution advisory and technical discussions**
- Comfortable working directly with stakeholders and translating requirements into systems

---

## How I Work

- Systems over scripts  
- Clarity over cleverness  
- Production constraints matter  
- Learn fast, adapt faster  

If something breaks, I want to understand *why*, not hide it.
